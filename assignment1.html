            South
            Africa was announced, chairman of selectors MSK Prasad made
            it clear that they were looking at Rohit Sharma as a specialist opener in Test cricket and that they were
            willing to give him a longer rope to be established in the role. Rohit has also found support from Sourav
            Ganguly and VVS Laxman, but according to former Indian wicket-keeper batsman Nayan Mongia, who himself was
            used
            as a makeshift opener in Test cricket, this new proposal might not be too successful.</p>
        <p style="font-family:'Gill Sans', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15pt">
            “Opening is a specialized job, like ‘keeping. He’s been opening in
            limited-overs cricket, but Test cricket
            requires a massive adjustment in mindset. Unless, of course, he decides to stick to what he does in
            limited-overs cricket - go for the ball. He must stick to his strengths, rather than change his game
            according
            to Test cricket. If he does that, it may affect his limited-overs game,” Mongia told Times of India.</p>

            “Why not give chances to those who’ve scored 1,000-800 runs in a season
            as an opener? The likes of Panchal and
            Easwaran are averaging 50-60 in domestic cricket. When are they going to get a chance? It’s demotivating for
            them,” he further added. The right-hander has not managed to nail down his spot in the longest format - in
            27
            Tests, he has scored 1,585 runs at an average of 39.62 with three hundreds and 10 fifties.</p>

            With KL Rahul struggling to get going at the top of the order, the
            selectors are now willing to try Rohit in a
            bid to solve the long-standing woes of openers in Test cricket. India will take on South Africa in a 3-match
            Test series. Currently, they are ranked number 1 on the World Test Championship points table with 120
            points.
